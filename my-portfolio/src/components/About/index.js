        <p>Hello Let's do this one more time!</p>
        <p> 
          
          My name is Andres Garcia, but you can call me Andy. I'm 28 years old,
          and I love to cook, watch anime, and learn new skills. I used to work
          in retail until I quit to learn a new skill: coding! I have been
          coding for 6 months now and have learned different skill sets like
          React, Tailwind, Node.js, and much more. My goal is to grow with a new
          company and expand my toolset. I am the one and only Andy.

          I started working in retail back in 2014 at Ralphs. I began as a clerk
          and slowly worked my way up. My first promotion was to combo-clerk,
          which meant I was both a clerk and a cashier. Shortly after, I was
          promoted to meat clerk and was introduced to a whole new world. I fell
          in love with the department, seeing huge slabs of meat being
          transformed into beautiful cuts for someone's dinner. After 2 and a
          half years of working as a clerk and learning as much as I could, I
          was promoted in 2017 to a Seafood Manager. My responsibilities
          increased along with my knowledge. I learned about product quality,
          order management, team building, and much more. Within 3 months of my
          position, I had the top comps in the district, and because of this, I
          was promoted to a higher-rated store. I went from a store rated C to a
          FreshFare, which is the best store you can work for. My attention to
          detail was definitely key to my success. My orders needed to be
          precise, my cuts had to be perfect to sell, and any slow-selling items
          had to be sold in a creative way. Overall, my experience was great,
          but I got an opportunity I couldn't pass up.
        </p>

          After two years working as a Seafood Manager, I reached a standstill
          in my career. My goal was to become a butcher, but unfortunately,
          there were no openings, and with so many backup butchers, moving up
          didn't seem likely. After a conversation with my Meat Manager/Mentor,
          I found out he was taking an opportunity out of state and would be
          quitting. After doing some deep thinking, I decided to hit the reset
          button. The day I decided to quit working at Ralphs, I found a posting
          at Wholefoods for a full-time Meat and Seafood position, and this is
          the next part of my journey. After a month, I was awarded Team Member
          of the month, and after three months, I had an opportunity to apply
          for a Team Trainer position at the store. I got it, and my journey up
          the corporate ladder began. My responsibilities were simple - show new
          members the who, what, where, when, and why of the department - but I
          wanted to move up quickly, so I added more responsibilities. I started
          writing orders, working on merchandising displays, leading team focus
          exercises, and much more. Almost a year later, I was promoted to ATL,
          Assistant Team Leader.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an ATL, I was in charge of the department when the Team Leader was
          not around. Since I was already doing the role of an ATL, my
          responsibilities didn't change much, but my skills improved. Since I
          had a budget to keep, my orders had to be on point. I used sales
          records, shrink records, and much more. Shrink, sales, and comps were
          all being met, and I am proud to say I trained two team members to
          become ATLs, showing them the ropes and passing along what I had
          learned. One day on my lunch break, I stumbled across a video on 'How
          to Build a Calculator App using JavaScript.' After that, I watched
          'How to Build a Battleship Game using JavaScript.' From there, I fell
          in love with this new field, and I wanted to learn more. After doing
          some research, I found a bootcamp from UCLA. I applied and got in
        </p>
        <p>
          As I worked in the mornings and attended class at night, I was
          definitely stressed out. The job was very demanding, especially since
          the bootcamp was during the holidays, which were the busy months for
          me. It got to the point where I wasn't learning and wasn't performing
          my best at work. This is where I had to make a choice: give up on this
          course and focus on WholeFoods or quit WholeFoods and take some time
          to learn a new skill. I chose to learn a new skill. Now, I'm trying to
          learn as much as I can and find a new company to grow with
