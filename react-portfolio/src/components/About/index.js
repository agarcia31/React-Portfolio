        My first job was at Ralphs. I was 19 years old starting off as a bagger with simple responabities. With time and taking on more responabities I was able to learn how to operate a register. A year later I was promoted into the Meat and Seafood department. That's where I found a new passion and fell in love with learning on the operation of the department. I learned food safety, food handing, and chemical handing training with cerifations and that's not including everything I learned on the job. Things like diffferent cuts of meat and best way to prepare, customer service, speed/resourcefullness, and much more. As My knowledge grew so did so did my work ethics, as a meat clerk I was put incharged of ordering, inventory control, displays and training new employees for the department. Being able to learned all these skills I was soon promoted to Seafood Manager. The responiblities that it comes with were Quality control, strong understanding of fish products, ordering, skrink control, team-managent, and much more. To put the postion into different works, I was an assitant manager to the meat manager, but responible for both Meat and Seafood Departments. I worked as a manager for almost 2 years. One day after a discussion with my current manger I found out he was leaving, and I took this oppurtonties to leave. My manager was leaving the company, and I felt like I needed a change of workplace. The day I decide to find a new job I found a posting for a full time position in the Meat & Seafood Departments at wholefoods. Within a month I was Team Memeber of the Month, 5 months after that I became Team-Trainer. I was incharge of working with new team members, showing them the ropes, and explaining the who,what,where,when, and why. I'm proud to say I trained 2 team members to become assitent Team-Leader. Speaking of assitant Team-Leader I become one 1 year and 4 months into working the company. I become fully cerfited in food safety manager. With time comes new skills like filleting, smoking fish, attention to details, stonger ordering skills, stroger shrink control, and much more. One day on my lunch I watch a video on how to make a calulator using Javascipt and basic css, after that a video on how to make a tic-tac-toe using JavaScript and I found a new passion. After talking to my brother we looked up which bootcamp is the best for us and after looking we found UCLA bootcamp. We enrolled into a bootcamp and from one day I was introduce into a new world and fell inlove once again. LEarning basic html and css was definaly fun but once the holiday came and my job got alot more stresfull I had to make a very important decision in my life. I was almost 4 years in working for the compant when I enrolled into the bootcamp and it got to the point where I couldnt sleep or working at my best at work. I decised to quit my job half way threw the bootcamp and take this oppurtunity to take time and learn a new skill properly. I enrolled into the bootcamp to learn a new skill and working 50 plus hours a week make it impossible to learn everything I needed to learn. Once I quit that's when I was able to study more and have a better understanding of the materials. From learning node.js to MongoBD to Bootsrapt to React. I learned alot and definaly added more to my skillset. I'm not done learning not by a long shot. I definaly want to gorw my skills as much as I can.
