        My first job was at Ralphs. I was 19 years old and started off as a bagger. With time I was able to work the register, get into the meat and seafood department. I found a new passion and wanted to learn everthing I could. I learned food safety, food handing, and chemical handing training with cerifations. As My knowledge grew so did so did my work ethics, as a meat clerk I was put incharged of ordering, inventory control, and displays. Being able to learned all these new skills I was than promoted to Seafood Manager. The responiblities that it comes with were Quality control, strong understanding of fish products, ordering, skrink control, and team-managent. Think of it as assitant manager to the Meat department, but responible for both Meat and Seafood Departments. I worked there for alittle over 5 years. My manager was leaving the company, and I felt like I needed a change. The day I decide to find a new job I found a posting for a full time position in the Meat & Seafood Departments at wholefoods. Within a month I was Team Memeber of the Month, 5 months after that I became Team-Trainer. I was incharge of working with new team members, showing them the ropes, and explaining the who,what,where,when, and why. I'm proud to say I trained 2 team members to become assitent Team-Leader. Speaking of assitant Team-Leader I become one 1 year and 4 months in. I become fully cerfited in managent food safety. With time comes new skills like filleting, smoking fish, attention to details, stonger ordering skills, stroger shrink control, and much more. I enrolled into a bootcamp from UCLA one day after talking to my brother. I was almost 4 years in when I enrolled into the bootcamp. I quit my job half way threw the bootcamp. I enrolled into the bootcamp to learn a new skill and working 50 plus hours a week make it impossible to learn everything I needed to learn. Once I quit that's when I was able to study more and have a better understanding of the materials. From learning node.js to MongoBD to Bootsrapt to React. I learned alot and definaly added more to my skillset. I'm not done learning not by a log shot I want to gorw my skills as much as I can.  </p>
